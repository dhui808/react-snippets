### What frameworks does React use consume REST services?
    Fetch: supports promises, async await
    Axios:
    Superagent: support promises
    jQuery:

### Asynchronous communication
    React itself doesn't handle asynchronous communication with REST APIs directly. Instead, it relies on JavaScript 
    techniques and libraries to handle asynchronous requests and responses.
    
    React components typically use the component lifecycle methods like componentDidMount or useEffect to trigger 
    the request and update the component's state with the response data.

### i18n
     react-intl, i18next, and formatjs
